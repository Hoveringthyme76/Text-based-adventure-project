# Text-based-adventure-project

This is a project that is focused on making a text-based RPG, centered around solving puzzles to reach the top of a tower.

## Installation

The only thing this program needs is C++ on the latest version.

## Contributing

As of now, I'm not planning on making any changes in this program. But if anyone wishes to make a few changes with this game,
Please let me know and I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have about this project.
